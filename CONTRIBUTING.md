### Release Process ðŸš€

We use [`release-please-action`][release-please-action-link] to automate versioning and changelog generation, along with a GitHub workflow that automatically publish the templates to [brickhub.dev][brickhub_link].

### How it works:

- ðŸ“Œ **On Every Commit to main:**
    - Commits are analyzed using [Conventional Commits][conventional_commits_link].
    - If a version bump is needed, a **release PR** is automatically created or updated by [`release-please-action`][release-please-action-link].
    - The **release PR** includes:
        - An updated `CHANGELOG.md`
        - A version bump in `brick.yaml`

    ##### ðŸ’¡ Notes

    - Release PR's are created **per template**.
    - The GitHub Action workflow that automates the release process is configured in `.github/workflows/release_please.yaml`
    - release-please settings are defined in `.release-please-config.json` and `.release-please-manifest.json`
    - The release PR can be manually edited before merging.
    - The release PR should be merged **ONLY** when a new release is needed.

<br />

- âœ… **When the Release PR Is Merged:**
    - A new Git tag is created.
    - A GitHub Release is published with the changelog.
    - A new version of the brick is automatically published in [brickhub.dev][brickhub_link].

    #### ðŸ’¡ Notes
    
    - GitHub Releases are created **per template**.
    - The publishing process is automatically triggered when a version tag is created.
    - The automated publishing workflows to [brickhub.dev][brickhub_link] are defined in `.github/workflows/publish_<template-name>.yaml`
