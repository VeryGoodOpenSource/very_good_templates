### Build Hooks 🔨

This plugin includes build hooks support for compiling native code alongside your Dart code. Build hooks enable you to:

- Compile C/C++/Rust code during the build process
- Bundle native assets with your plugin
- Use Dart FFI to call native functions seamlessly

#### Using Build Hooks

The build hooks are automatically invoked during `dart run`, `dart build`, or `flutter build`. No manual steps required!

#### Example Native Function

Each platform implementation includes an example native `add` function that's already bound via FFI. Here's how to use it:

```dart
import 'package:{{project_name.snakeCase()}}_linux/{{project_name.snakeCase()}}_linux.dart';

void main() {
  // The add function is already exposed via @Native annotation
  // in lib/src/native_bindings.dart
  final result = add(24, 18); // Returns 42
  print('24 + 18 = $result');
}
```

The native bindings are located in each platform's `lib/src/native_bindings.dart` file, which uses the `@Native` annotation to automatically link to the compiled native code.

#### Adding More Native Code

1. Add your C source files to the `src/` directory
2. Update `hook/build.dart` to include your new sources
3. Call your native functions from Dart using FFI

For more information, see the [Dart build hooks documentation][dart_hooks_link].

### Integration tests 🧪

Very Good Flutter Plugin uses [fluttium][fluttium_link] for integration tests. Those tests are located 
in the front facing package `{{project_name.snakeCase()}}` example. 

**❗ In order to run the integration tests, you need to have the `fluttium_cli` installed. [See how][fluttium_install].**

To run the integration tests, run the following command from the root of the project:

```sh
cd {{project_name.snakeCase()}}/example
fluttium test flows/test_platform_name.yaml
```
